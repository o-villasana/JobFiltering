# Job Filter[in]g
Did you know that LinkedIn Job searches return up to 1,000 results? But what good is that if a user had to go through each one to find which roles they actually are qualified for? That would take up so much time and mental effort. However, if users had the option to filter for roles based on years of experience, they could easily focus their energy only on roles they have the necessary years of experience for. We are creating a browser extension to filter those results for you.
